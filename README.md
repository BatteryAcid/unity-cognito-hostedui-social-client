## Add Cognito's Hosted UI signup/login with social IDP option to Unity

This project is a Unity client that demonstrates how to use AWS Cognito's hosted UI to authenticate with 
social identity providers (like Google, Facebook, etc) as well as typical username and password.

Note: this is not a production ready implementation, but more of a jumping-off point to help you get started on your project.

To use this with your AWS setup, you have to update both [AuthenticationManager](https://github.com/BatteryAcid/unity-cognito-hostedui-social-client/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/AuthenticationManager.cs#L10) and [ApiManager](https://github.com/BatteryAcid/unity-cognito-hostedui-social-client/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/ApiManager.cs#L6) with your configuration.
